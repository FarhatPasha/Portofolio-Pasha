# Pasha's Portfolio

This is a simple personal portfolio website created for my **Introduction to Computer Science** assignment.

The site includes:
- My name and a profile photo
- A short bio
- At least three projects (including my C++ "Windows Roulette" game)
- Contact information

The website is built with **HTML** and **CSS**, and it is published using **GitHub Pages**.
